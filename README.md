# CollabHelper
A Collection of apps to help people through the Covid 19 outbreak and more.  

### Origin

While self Isolating we couldn't help but thing that we should be doing more.  If technology has taken over the world, than surely it can help now.  While the first instinct was to try and solve all the problems at once, we've decided that down and start very small.  

Helping people help people.

### Helping out

If you would like to help out, we would definitely be grateful, hit us up on twitter [@barranger](https://twitter.com/barranger) or [@annie_Berger](https://twitter.com/annie_Berger) 

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

MVP is a software term that that means "What's the least this product can do to still be useful". For the start of this project, here is how we are trying to help:

1) Person A states that they are going to be going to a store in an hour

2) A notification goes to all of the friends and family that Person A has set up including Person B

3) Person B states that they need a can of diced Tomatoes

4) Person A goes to the store and Buys the can of diced Tomatoes

5) Person A Drops off the can at Person B's home

6) *Outside of this Flow* Person B sends the money to Person A

**_Note: this app does not handle the settlement side_**

 

Given those requirements, here are the discrete tasks we will be looking at for the first version.

- [ ] User can sign up/sign in with Facebook
- [ ] User can invite a user to be part of their network
- [ ] User can state that they plan on going to the store
- [ ] System sends out a notification to all a users network asking if they want anything
- [ ] User can state what they need from the store
- [ ] System informs all parties that payment must be handled outside of the application
- [ ] User can state that they have picked up an item (or that it's isn't available)
